# Adobe Stock API SDKs

Here you will find official SDKs for use with the Adobe Stock APIs. Please note that these repositories have moved from this URL, and are now each located in their own repository.

* JavaScript SDK for Stock: https://github.com/adobe/stock-api-libjs
* Java SDK for Stock: https://github.com/adobe/stock-api-libjava
* Stock SDK for PHP: https://github.com/adobe/stock-api-libphp

Inside each project folder you will find a README with instructions for use.

Note that the SDK does not generate an access token for licensing operations. For that, consult the [Adobe Stock API documentation](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/stock/docs/getting-started.html).

In addition, there is some sample code available for the repositories located at https://github.com/adobe/stock-api-samples.
